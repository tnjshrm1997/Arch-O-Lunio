On the chit would be written the name of any object (eg. Sharpener, pen, fan, etc.). Now the participant, according to the object on the chit, would have to express his/her life as that object in a specified amount of time like 30 seconds or a minute. The participant who is spontaneous enough and is able to talk without taking excessive time out gets promoted to the next round.<br>Eg.- Suppose the participant has to talk about a pen. He/she could start by talking about where he/she was made, what is he/she made of, who were his/her previous owners, any specific accident that might have happened to him/her in the past, etc. (The idea is to be spontaneous enough so that you’re able to talk for the specified amount of time).<br><br>Round 2: 5-6 random words or quotes would be given to the participant and using those words or quotes, they would have to make up an interesting story or a plot.Now, after the participant has written his/her story, they will be asked to be a critic of their own story and thus, they will have to point out the loopholes in it.<br>Eg.- Suppose the participant has been given a quote “Live within your income, even if you have to borrow to do so”. Now the participant has to come up with an interesting story or a plot that is somewhat related to the quote, directly or indirectly. After writing the story or the plot, the participant would be asked to critically analyze their own story or plot and point out the loopholes in it.<br><br>Round 3: A half drawn painting will be given to the participant and the participant, using their own imaginative and creative skills would have to complete the drawing and give it a deep meaningful touch. The participant has to explain what the painting depicts either orally or by writing.<br>Eg.- Suppose the participant has been given a half drawn painting of a scenery. The participant then would have to draw the other half using his/her creative skills and give the painting a meaningful touch. It’s not necessary that the other half should be related to the scenery. In the end, the full painting should carry a meaning.<br><br>Round 4:The participant would be shown a series of pictures relating to anything. He/she would then have to write a meaningful poem relating to the series of pictures and then decipher it.<br>Eg.- Suppose the participant is shown a series of 5 pictures that consists of a picture of a beautiful  valley, a picture of a boy, a picture of a dog, a picture of a flower and a picture of a river. Now the participant has to link these pictures in a way so as to make a meaningful poem out of it. He/she would then have to decipher the poem.<br><br><br><br><b>Coordinators:</b><br>Kriti +91 75501 72822<br>Vagisha +91 78570 47203<br>Vidushi +91 89392 69226<br>Pranav +91 99208 43823',
